# Understanding Mechanism Design

The _Base_ panel allows you to sketch kinematic diagrams of planar mechanisms containing links and revolute and prismatic joints. These mechanisms can be one- or multi-degree of freedom.

## 1. Draw a Rotating Link

Select _Draw_ Link, and click and drag on the canvas. Each link has two joints at its ends. While a joint is selected, ground it from the context menu, and add a rotary actuator to that same joint.

When a joint is selected, a joint menu appears, which allows you to apply different constraints and conditions to it. Most of the icons in this context menu are toggle type.

## 2. Make a Three-Bar Structure

Now, let us draw three links connected end to end with each other. This is a structure, which does not permit relative motion of links.

## 3. Draw a Four-Bar Mechanism

Now, let us draw four links connected end to end with each other. Ground one link and add a rotary actuator at one of the connected joints of the grounded link. This is called a Four-bar mechanism, which has one Degree of Freedom (DOF). Simply put, each DOF requires one motor to uniquely move a mechanism.

### A Crank-Rocker Four-Bar Mechanism

<DocImage

  alt="four bar links"
  maxWidth="36rem"
/>

A crank refers to a link that fully rotates, while a rocker oscillates back and forth. A coupler couples crank and the rocker.

### Effect of Changing ground link

Experiment with changing the ground link (you have four choices) and see what different motions emerge.

  alt="four bar links"
  border={true}

<br />

The rectangular link is the grounded one.

### Different Coupler Curves

Add new points on the coupler by selecting the _Add Joint_ option and then clicking on the coupler to see new motion curves. The following image shows a few curves generated by using the _Add Joint_ option from the Base Panel.

<br />

These curves are created by the movement of different points on the coupler.
