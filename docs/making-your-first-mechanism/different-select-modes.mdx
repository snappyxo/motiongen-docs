# Different Select Modes

_Select_, _Multi-Select_, _Mech-Select_ in the Base panel enable you to select elements on the canvas and transform them differently.

## Select

You can move a link around by selecting its body or change its length by selecting a joint on the link and moving it around. This mode will change the links length to ensure connectivity of the mechanism.

  border={true}

## Multi-Select

You can select the entire mechanism by drawing a rectangle that crosses all the elements that you want to select. Then, you can move, rotate, or scale them as a whole. You can apply these transformations on individual links as well.

## Mech-Select

You can move links around without changing their geometry. You can use a singular joint to move the link around the pivot. This mode is useful when your link lengths are fixed and you simply want to assemble them.
