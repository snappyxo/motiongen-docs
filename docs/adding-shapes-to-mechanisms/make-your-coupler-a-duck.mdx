# Make your Coupler a Duck

What if you want your coupler to be in the shape of a duck?

1. Draw a duck using _Draw Arbitrary_ Shape.
2. Draw a small link inside of the duck using Draw Link.
3. Use _Multi-Select_ to select both the duck and the link inside it.
4. Use Merge to combine them to make the duck a bonafide link.
5. Using the duck, make a four bar mechanism like the star-coupler mechanism above.
