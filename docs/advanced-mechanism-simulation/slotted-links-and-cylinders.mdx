# Understanding Slotted Links and Cylinders

Basic links have a solid body and two joints. Advanced links such as slotted links or cylinders help design mechanisms with such links.

## Slotted Links

These links are useful to create a constrained linear motion.

The example mechanism above is used in a variety of applications, such as Internal combustion engines.

## Cylinders

Gas spring pistons or linear actuators can be simulated using the cylinder and the linear actuator option.
